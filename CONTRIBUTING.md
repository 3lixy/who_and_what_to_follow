# Public Participation and Contributions Invited!
My goal is that this repository to become a community public repository that supports participation by anyone. Please feel free to use the familiar [fork-and-pull collaboration model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) supported by GitHub and other distributed version-control systems. Any GitHub user wishing to contribute should fork the repository, make additions or other modifications, and then submit a pull request. GitHub pull requests should be accompanied by supporting comments and/or issues. Community conversations about pull requests, supported by GitHub notifications, will provide good context to merge, modify, close, or take other action.

Questions or comments about this Open Repository's activities should be composed as GitHub issues or comments.
